## Overview

The erikmisc is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. The __erikmisc__ package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the erikmisc in a single command.

If you'd like to learn how to use the erikmisc effectively, the best place to start is [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# The development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("erikerhardt/erikmisc")
```

## Usage

`library(erikmisc)` will load the core erikmisc packages:

* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.erikmisc.org), for data visualisation.
* [dplyr](https://dplyr.erikmisc.org), for data manipulation.
* [tidyr](https://tidyr.erikmisc.org), for data tidying.
* [readr](https://readr.erikmisc.org), for data import.
* [purrr](https://purrr.erikmisc.org), for functional programming.
* [tibble](https://tibble.erikmisc.org), for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames.
* [stringr](https://github.com/erikmisc/stringr), for strings.
* [forcats](https://github.com/erikmisc/forcats), for factors.

You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```{r example}
library(erikmisc)
```

You can see conflicts created later with `erikmisc_conflicts()`:

```{r conflicts}
library(MASS)
erikmisc_conflicts()
```

And you can check that all erikmisc packages are up-to-date with `erikmisc_update()`:

```{r update, eval = FALSE}
erikmisc_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * broom (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * DBI   (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#>  * Rcpp  (0.12.6 -> 0.12.7)
#> Update now?
#>
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```

## Packages

As well as the core erikmisc, installing this package also installs a selection of other packages that you're likely to use frequently, but probably not in every analysis. This includes packages for:

*   Working with specific types of vectors:

    * [hms](https://github.com/erikmisc/hms), for times.
    * [lubridate](https://github.com/erikmisc/lubridate), for date/times.

*   Importing other types of data:

    * [feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather), for sharing with Python and other languages.
    * [haven](https://github.com/erikmisc/haven), for SPSS, SAS and Stata files.
    * [httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr), for web apis.
    * [jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite) for JSON.
    * [readxl](https://github.com/erikmisc/readxl), for `.xls` and `.xlsx` files.
    * [rvest](https://github.com/erikmisc/rvest), for web scraping.
    * [xml2](https://github.com/r-lib/xml2), for XML.

*   Modelling

    * [modelr](https://github.com/erikmisc/modelr), for modelling within a pipeline
    * [broom](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom), for turning models into
      tidy data
