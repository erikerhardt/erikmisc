## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R
Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Testing chunks.  These should be given names while currently named chunks should be ignored.

```{r}
1
```

```{  r  }
2
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
3
```

```{   r, eval=FALSE}
4
```

```{r   , eval=FALSE}
5
```

```{r chunk-2, eval=FALSE}
6
```

```{r chunk-XXX  , eval=FALSE}
7
```

```{r chunk-XXX2 , eval=FALSE}
8
```

```{r chunk-XXX3 , eval=FALSE}
9
```

```{r chunk-XXX4 , eval=FALSE}
10
```

```{r chunk-XXX5 , eval=FALSE}
11
```

```{r chunk-XXX6 , eval=FALSE}
12
```

```{  R  }
"R13"
```

```{R, echo=FALSE}
"R14"
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent
printing of the R code that generated the plot.
