\itemize{
\item Excel supports two date systems, the 1900 date system and the 1904 date system.
\item Each date system uses a unique starting date from which all other workbook dates are calculated.
\item All versions of Excel for Windows calculate dates based on the 1900 date system.
\item Excel 2008 for Mac and earlier Excel for Mac versions calculate dates based on the 1904 date system.
\item Excel 2016 for Mac and Excel for Mac 2011 use the 1900 date system, which guarantees date compatibility with Excel for Windows.
}
\item For example, July 5, 2011, can have two different serial numbers, as follows:
\tabular{ll}{
Date System  \tab  Serial number \cr
1900         \tab  40729         \cr
1904         \tab  39267         \cr
}
}
}
