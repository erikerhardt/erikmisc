## Setting

* Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection

## Participants

* Cohort study --- Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants. Describe methods of follow-up
* Case-control study --- Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of case ascertainment and control selection. Give the rationale for the choice of cases and controls
* Cross-sectional study --- Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants
* Cohort study --- For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of exposed and unexposed
* Case-control study --- For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number of controls per case

## Variables

* Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable

## Data sources/ measurement

* *Give information separately for cases and controls in case-control studies and, if applicable, for exposed and unexposed groups in cohort and cross-sectional studies.

# Results {#sec-Results}

## Participants

* *Give information separately for cases and controls in case-control studies and, if applicable, for exposed and unexposed groups in cohort and cross-sectional studies.
* Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study --- eg numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed
* Give reasons for non-participation at each stage
* Consider use of a flow diagram

## Descriptive data

* *Give information separately for cases and controls in case-control studies and, if applicable, for exposed and unexposed groups in cohort and cross-sectional studies.
* (a) Give characteristics of study participants (eg demographic, clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential confounders
* (b) Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest
* (c) Cohort study --- Summarise follow-up time (eg, average and total amount)

## Outcome data

* *Give information separately for cases and controls in case-control studies and, if applicable, for exposed and unexposed groups in cohort and cross-sectional studies.
* Cohort study --- Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time
* Case-control study --- Report numbers in each exposure category, or summary measures of exposure
* Cross-sectional study --- Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures

## Main results

* Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included
* Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorized
* If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period

## Other analyses

* Report other analyses done --- eg analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses

{{< pagebreak >}}

# Discussion {#sec-Discussion}

## Key results

* Summarise key results with reference to study objectives

## Limitations

* Discuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias

## Interpretation

* Give a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence

## Generalisability

* Discuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results

## Summary of the main findings.

## Implications of the study.

## Suggestions for future research.
