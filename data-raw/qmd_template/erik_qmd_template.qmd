## Figures

Here I crossreference the subfigures of the figure.
The main figure is @fig-charts, with the subpanels being called
@fig-charts-1 and @fig-charts-2, automatically.

```{r}
#| label: fig-charts
#| fig-cap: Two charts
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - "Speed and Stopping Distances of Cars"
#|   - "Vapor Pressure of Mercury as a Function of Temperature"
#| layout-ncol: 2

plot(cars)
plot(pressure)
```

Here I crossreference the subfigures of the figure.
The main figure is @fig-charts2, with the subpanels being called
@fig-charts2-1, @fig-charts2-2, and @fig-charts2-3, automatically.

```{r}
#| label: fig-charts2
#| fig-cap: Three charts
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - "Speed and Stopping Distances of Cars"
#|   - "Vapor Pressure of Mercury as a Function of Temperature"
#|   - "Motor Trend Car Road Tests"

#| fig-width:   8
#| fig-height:  6

```

## Tables

Here I crossreference the subtables of the table.
The main table is @tbl-example, with the subpanels being called
@tbl-example-1 and @tbl-example-2, automatically.


```{r}
#| label: tbl-example
#| tbl-cap: "Example"
#| tbl-subcap:
#|   - "Cars"
#|   - "Pressure"
#| layout-ncol: 2

knitr::kable(head(cars))
knitr::kable(head(pressure))
```

## Equations

Black-Scholes (@eq-black-scholes) is a mathematical model that seeks to explain
the behavior of financial derivatives, most commonly options:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm C^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C
$$ {#eq-black-scholes}


## Crossreference sections {#sec-crossref-sections}

See @sec-crossref-sections for additional context.

## Crossreference code

To xref code <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html>, it's a bit strange.

Create the label, then use .r, then a list caption.
Note that the code is not executed!
Then you can xref by the label (@lst-code-xref).

```{#lst-code-xref .r lst-cap="Code xref"}
seq(1, 10, by = 2)
```

## Margins and layout

See <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html>.

Here is an inline footnote.^[Inlines notes are easy to write,
since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to
type the note.]

[This is a span that has the class aside which places it in the margin without
a footnote number.]{.aside}


## Callouts

:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.
